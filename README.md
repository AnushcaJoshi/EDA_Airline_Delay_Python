# Exploratory Data Analysis for Airline Delay

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into airline delay data. The analysis aims to understand the patterns and factors contributing to delays in the airline industry.

## Introduction
Airline delays have significant implications for both passengers and airlines, leading to disruptions in travel schedules, financial losses, and customer dissatisfaction. Exploring and understanding the underlying causes of delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and customer experience.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from a CSV file named airline_delay.csv, which I used from Kaggle. Containing information on airline delays for various carriers and airports.


## Methodology
1. Importing Libraries: Important libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported for data analysis and visualization.

2. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

3. Basic Insights: Basic statistical insights about the dataset, including summary statistics and data types, are examined using the describe() and info() methods.

4. Visualization: Data visualization techniques are employed to explore relationships and patterns within the dataset. Bar plots and scatter plots are used to visualize carrier delays and their distribution over the years.

5. Identifying Delay Types: The maximum delay type (e.g., weather delay, NAS delay) for each carrier is determined to understand the primary factors contributing to delays.


## Conclusion
This EDA project provides valuable insights into airline delays, highlighting the importance of understanding delay patterns and contributing factors. By identifying key insights from the analysis, airlines and relevant stakeholders can develop strategies to mitigate delays, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers.
